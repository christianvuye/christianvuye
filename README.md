## 🌍 the journey so far

**from functional analyst to founding engineer to ai agent fleet commander 🫡**

i'm a curious generalist software developer who loves to dive into a variety of different fields and technologies - my journey has taken me from automating business processes at Honda 🏎️ to producing games 🎮, from (co-)founding mutltiple companies to orchestrating a fleet of ai agents that help me create amazing software. 

**currently:** figuring out my next steps in barcelona (after my last startup *crashed and burned* 🔥🔥🔥🔥)  
**mission:** lifelong learning, exploring and pushing the limits  
**philosophy:** *"the important thing is not to stop questioning - curiosity has its own reason for existence."* 🧠 (some very smart person said this, *not me*)
